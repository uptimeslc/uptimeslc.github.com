Welcome to Uptime SLC, a new idea around the Technology User Group. This group meets at 6:30 p.m. on the first Thursday of every month at a yet to be determined location. The meetings vary every month, unlike a traditional user group might.

Uptime SLC will focus on a broad subject for 3 months at a time.

  The first month will be a short, broad lecture, much like the standard meetings currently happening at any other user group.

  Month two, however, will differ in that there will be a hands on workshop around the subject. Each attendee will be expected to bring a laptop and provided with some basic instruction and a general goal. During the three-hour session, proctors will be in the room to assist with questions.

  During month three, a T table will be placed onto a white board. This board will have teachers and learners. Topics and names will be put onto the board and small groups will organically organize and discuss the topic detail.
