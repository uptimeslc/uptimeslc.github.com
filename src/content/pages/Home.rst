Welcome to UptimeSLC, a new concept around the Technology User Group. UptimeSLC is a topic-centric group. This meeans that the meetings will vary every month, allowing more in-depth evaluation and discussion of a topic.

  The first meeting on a topic could be a short lecture, or intense discussion to introduce the topic or problem. This meeting is much like the standard meetings currently happening at any other user group.

  The second meeting will differ greatly from the first. A workshop or tutorial within the topic area will be provided. Each in-person attendee will be expected to bring a laptop. Some basic instruction and a general goal will be provided. During the three-hour session, proctors will be available to assist with questions.

  During month three, focus groups will evaluate the subect further. A simple T table will be written on a board or paper. It will have the title 'teachers' at the head of one column, and 'learners' in the other. Topics and names will be put onto the board and small groups will organically organize and discuss the topic in further detail.

Meeting Time and Location
-------------------------

UptimeSLC meets at 6:30 p.m. on the third Tuesday of every month. Because uptimeSLC is topic-centric, the first and second meeting on each topic will be in person AND online. The third meeting on the topic will be in-person only as focus groups can really only be in-person.
