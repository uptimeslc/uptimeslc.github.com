Meetings

:date: 2015-01-22

UptimeSLC meets at 6:30 p.m. on the third Tuesday of every month. Because uptimeSLC is topic-centric, the first and second meeting on each topic will be in person AND online. The third meeting on the topic will be in-person only as focus groups can really only be in-person.
